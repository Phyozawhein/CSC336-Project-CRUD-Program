## App Concept

InstaList is a web application that allows users to create their own personal playlist of their liked songs. After signing up or logging in, users can go to the search bar, look up their favorite songs, albums, or artists, and add them to their playlist by liking them.

## Tools

### Frontend

- ReactJS
- Bootstrap

### Backend

- Postman
- MariaDB
- HeidiSQL

## Instructions

To use the software for this application, first clone the git repository into your own machine. Then, change directories into CSC336-Project1/insta-list/Frontend and install the nodejs dependencies in the local node_modules folder running npm install in the command line.

When they head to the "My Library" page, they will see all their liked songs there, and be able to unlike a song if they want to.

## Notes
Next steps for InstaList would be to allow users to be able to search for the playlists of other registered users and see their contents. We also would like users to be able to like the playlists of other users, and create multiple eprsonal playlists and be able to name them.
